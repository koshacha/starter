## Introduction

Quite an old project of mine that I created after graduating from university. The app was created using Electron, I used jQuery to add interactivity to the interface and Bootstrap was used for styling.

## **Purpose of the application**

The application accepts a list of domain names and checks their history in the Web Archive for errors, redirects.

## **Choosing Electron**

I wanted to learn the technology of creating desktop applications using JavaScript.
