## Introduction

At some point I needed a place where I could make myself known, talk about my skills and projects, that's how this site came about. I chose Svelte as a framework and during the whole time of development I have never regretted it. The interface of the site was created traditionally with Tailwind CSS, for hosting I used Vercel.

- I was inspired by [this site](https://leerob.io/) in many ways when I was creating the interface for my own

## Choosing a Svelte/SvelteKit framework

I visited the framework's website, went through the small tutorials provided on the site and I found this framework interesting. So, I decided to explore it more deeply and build a website on it. And man, I just love Svelte! It's easy to learn and presents an incredibly user-friendly development experience. I think it's perfect for building both simple and complex sites. It's a huge relief to come to Svelte after React.js and realize that you don't have to worry about things like memoizing components.

## Work Progress

In the course of my work, I learned all the details of developing in Svelte, from simple components, to complex logic in +server.ts files. The posts on the site are generated from Markdown files, dynamic image optimization is set up, and the interface is full of simple but nice animations. I also got more familiar with Vite.
