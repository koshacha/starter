# Phone DB Explorer

My old React.js project. The client needed a SPA, which could be used to explore MySQL phone number database, make edits to it - for example, mark numbers as viewed and so on. An essential problem was the speed of the application - there could be several tables and they could include a enormous number of rows.

In the process, I developed the frontend on React.js + Bootstrap CSS, and the MySQL handler functions were implemented in PHP.
