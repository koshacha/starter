            Error 404, also known as "Page Not Found" error, occurs when a user
            tries to access a web page that does not exist or is no longer
            available on the server. When a web server receives a request from a
            user's browser for a specific page, it looks for the file on its
            server. If it cannot find the file or page requested, it returns a
            404 error message to the user's browser, indicating that the server
            could not find the requested resource.
